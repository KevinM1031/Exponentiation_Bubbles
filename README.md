# Exponentiation Bubbles
My "write a game in 24 hours challenge" done with JavaScript to learn the language.

The game is really simple and you can probably figure out how to play it on your own,
but if you want some instructions:

  * Pop bubbles with your gun.
  * Avoid getting hit by bubbles.
  * If you clear all the bubbles, you will automatically progress to the next round.
  
  - You can upgrade your character, buy new guns, and upgrade guns with coins.
  - Bigger bubbles can divide more. They also have exponentially higher HP and damage.

Don't read into the code though. I wrote this during final exam week and everything is
rushed and spaghettificated.
